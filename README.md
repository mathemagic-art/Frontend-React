## Installation

- Check if you have installed the following tools' latest updates ✈️

1. Nodejs
1. npm

- You can check if you have these tools installed by going to your terminal and running the following commands:

```bash
    $ node -v
```

```bash
    $ npm -v
```

- Important: you must have the latest updates of these tools if not please update to the latest versions

- Use Git to clone the repository in a location on your machine 🍎

```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/mathemagic-art/Frontend-React.git
```

```bash
    $ cd Frontend-React
```

- Make sure you are in the correct location in the terminal: inside the Frontend folder if not cd to this location: then run the following command to install all the dependencies

```bash
    $ npm install
```

- This command should install all the dependencies needed to run react app, if you get any error in this step means you have some problem with the Nodejs version or npm please check those and try again.

- After installing all the dependencies you must be ready to Start: run the following command to open the app in localhost 3000 in your default browser 🍎

```bash
    $ npm start
```

- If you get any error in this step please read the error message in the terminal or console of your browser and try to resolve it by provided guidelines: if you couldn't figure it out, run the following command to audit it automatically:

```bash
    $ npm run audit
```

Or you can use a forced flag if a normal case wouldn't work

```bash
    $ npm run audit -f
```

- Then try to run the

```bash
  $ npm start
```

command again. This will hopefully work.

## How to Contribute: Git Conventions 🕵️‍♀️

### How to use git 😋

- You can work on the assigned component or feature and use the following steps to push your code to the repo

```bash
  $ git add "name of the file or all"
```

```bash
  $ git commit -m "message of commit: please read the guidelines for commit message"
```

```bash
  $ git push
```

### Git commit message guidelines 🔔

- Use the following keywords in each case for better readability 🐒

- "added: if you have created a new component or layout or page write the name here"
- "updated: if you have added or removed features to a component write the name of comp"
- "fixed: if you have fixed a bug, write the name of comp and bug type here"
- "deleted: if you have deleted any comp or feature or page write the name here"

* please strictly follow the guidelines on the commit message so we will have a fun collaboration" \_ Nazari
